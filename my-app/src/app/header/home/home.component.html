    <p>rem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
    been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    Why do we use it
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
    of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
    more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now
    use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
    web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
    Where does it come from?
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word
    in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.
    10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
      in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
